# etch-a-sketch
Etch-a-sketch is a simple paint application that allows a user to paint on a customizable sized grid. Brush color is either black or random with an added layering feature that adds opacity as you continue to pass over a certain square in the paiting area. This is built with vanilla javascript, html, and CSS.
